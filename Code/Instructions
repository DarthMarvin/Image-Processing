I included the raw files. The folders that are empty correspond to the filters that I did not use. The code creates new images that get stored in their respective folders.
Code Order
MasterDark- Takes an average from all the dark frames.
MasterFlats- Takes an average from all the flat frames for each filter.
Correction- Calibrates all images using the MasterDarks and MasterFlats.
Alignment- Uses stars to align all the images, correcting for any drift during the capture process.
Stacker- Creates a master image for each filter by stacking them. Stacking is done by taking an average to increase signal to noise ratio.
